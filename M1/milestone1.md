# Milestone 1: Project description and Needfinding: McHome


## Overview and planning
Our group wants to observe the process that university students go through when planning their meals. We focused on situations where they have a short amount of time for planning, preparing and eating the meal. Additionally, we would like to understand how healthy the students perceive their meals and if they would like to improve this aspect.

Our focus is off-site students, both Italian or international because they have to prepare their meals by themselves.

Furthermore, we decided to categorize them based on their cooking skills and their off-site experience. Thus, we are going to observe:

- two new to cooking students: never cooked meals alone before the current academic year
- two already used to cooking students (one of them being an international student)

We wanted to observe both new to cooking and experienced ones because their experience in managing time and ingredients could be different.

The selection of an international student was made thinking about the extra difficulties they might have based on different cultural backgrounds. Thus, they might have more problems with the ingredients selection.

These observations allowed us to comprehend the cooking preparation habits of students: time management, ingredients' shopping, meal decision, ingredients usage... Thus, we're able to validate the necessities of the students we thought to exist previously that were the centre of our project idea. This is because we want to provide students with a tool to help them prepare quick and healthy meals with the ingredients they have available at home. 


## Observation
### João - Experienced cooking student 

João is an international student in his last year of studies. He has been an offsite student for the whole duration of his career. Thus, he already has a good cooking experience.

</p>

In the observation, we were able to see that the place where the student cooks is small. In the cooking preparation, he gathered all the ingredients and tools needed to start cooking the meal, showing that he is organized when cooking. When retrieving the ingredients for the meal, we could observe that neither the fridge nor the pantry of the student was very full. This might indicate that the student doesn't do a lot of advanced planning of his meals.

The meal preparation took about 25min.

### Paolo - New to cooking student 

On the day of the interview, in the morning, paolo had class so he took some ingredients right away before returning home. He has a grocery list on his phone to don't forget anything when he goes shopping.

</p>

Paolo is not yet a capable cook. Thus, he often cooks the same recipes using the same ingredients. He mentioned that he is cooking with the identical ingredients as the day before. This way, except for one or two purchased before, he had all the ingredients available at home. However, he also said that he would like to improve the lack of variety of ingredients. Excluding weekends, he feels that he often doesn't have time to try something new.

His meal preparation took about 20 min.

### Alessia - New to cooking student 
Alessia is an Italian student who decided to enrol in Politecnico of Turin last year for her master's degree. She has been an off-site student for a year because she attended a university that is very close to her place for her three-year degree. However, she is not used to cooking now, even if she has one year of experience. 

The observed student seems to be organized, at first glance: she had all the needed ingredients in her fridge so she didn't have to go shopping for something missing. She decided what to eat right before starting to cook and without opening the fridge to see what was available. She prepared pasta with pesto and took 15 minutes to prepare her whole meal, 5 minutes to boil the water and 10 to cook pasta and dress it with pesto. She was happy about that because she could also rest a little bit before coming back to class.

</p>

What it was possible to observe in her pantry is that there is a lot of rice, pasta, tuna and a set of different sauces. All lead to say that the student prefers to cook easy meals and the biggest priority is to spend a small amount of time. 

### Ramon - Experienced cooking student 

Ramon is an Italian student in his last year of studies. He has been living alone for some years and he's used to cooking his meals by himself. He has a daily plan with a well-defined list of ingredients.

It was possible to observe that as a used-to cooking student, he has already-prepared ingredients stored in the fridge to prepare his meal. Furthermore, he already had everything he needed to start cooking. 
Another observation made was that in the pantry, he stores a large amount of dry food.

His meal preparation took about 25min.


## Interviews
### Questions

1. Do you plan your meals?

## Diary
Student days can vary a lot since their schedule changes daily. To better understand their needs, we decided to deepen our knowledge of their habits with the help of a diary. We asked to fill it for two lunches and two dinners on two weekdays. For each meal, we asked the same questions that could be completed quickly. 

### João's diary
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/joao_front.jpg" height="450"/>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/JoaoDiary.jpg" height="450"/>
</p>

João spent on average 20 minutes cooking. He opted for quick and easy to do meals. We can see that he never planned his meals in advance but surprisingly, he didn't have a problem with missing ingredients. That's because he probably cooked based only on what he had available. We can also observe that pasta was, three times out of four, a central ingredient in his meals. However, he thinks that his meals were healthy enough.

### Paolo's diary
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/paolo_diary.jpg" height="450"/>
</p>

Paolo spent on average 20 minutes cooking. Except for one day, he had all the ingredients available at home, probably because he is good at organizing himself. For most meals, he chose what to eat in the morning. He had the perception that his dishes were quite healthy, even if he fried the ready-made frozen fish and he ate carbs in most of his meals.

### Alessia's diary
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/AlessiaDiary.jpg" height="450"/>
</p>
Alessia spent on average 30 minutes cooking. We can see that she doesn't plan her meals and decides what to eat just before starting to cook or a little earlier. She has most of the ingredients available at home, probably because she eats very simple meals with some ready-made ingredients. We can also see that for the first lunch she didn't prepare the meal by herself. Despite this, she believes that her preparations were quite healthy.

### Ramon's Diary

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/RamonDiary.jpg" height="450"/>
</p>

Ramon spent on average 10 minutes cooking. We can see that on the first day he planned what to eat in advance. On the second day, his decision to eat lunch happened right after class and he had a "take away pizza" for dinner. He had all the ingredients he needed available at home except for the second-day dinner. We can also see that he's used to cooking healthy food.


## User Needs
After interviewing the students we were able to identify several user needs:

1. Improve the variety of dishes prepared
2. Enhance their cooking skills
3. Recipes that take less time than ones online or in books 
4. Reduce wasted food
5. Healthier recipes

## Project Description
Our project will include the possibility to search for quick and simple recipes based on specific ingredients with attention to healthy meals.
Due to the ease and immediacy of use, our project will consist in a web application for smartphones.
